= Linux

This document describes the process of building and installing Egoboo under
Linux. 

== Requirements
Building Egoboo on Linux requires a recent version of GCC (5.1 or later) and
GNU Make (3.81 or later). Furthermore the runtime and development version of the
following libraries need to be installed:

	- SDL2
	- SDL2_mixer
	- SDL2_image
	- SDL2_ttf
	- OpenGL
	- enet
	- PhysFS 2.0 or later
	- ncurses

Install the runtime and development versions of those libraries from the
package manager of your distribution.

==  Building and Installing

To build Egoboo enter
```
make all
sudo make install
````
which will build and install the game into the default installation prefix.

=== Remarks
To install Egoboo using a different installation prefix, enter
```
make all PREFIX=<PREFIX>
sudo make install PREFIX=<PREFIX>
```
In particular, if super-user permissions are not available, Egoboo can be
installed to a local directory by defining a PREFIX environmental variable
on the command-line. A common usage would be
```
make all PREFIX=$HOME/.local
make install PREFIX=$HOME/.local
````
which will build and install the game into the home folder.

== Launching
To start the game, execute `<PREFIX>/games/egoboo-2.x`.
